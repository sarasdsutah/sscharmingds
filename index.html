		Hi, friends! Welcome to my website. My name is Sara Song, data professional with 5 years of experience in modeling, sales/marketing/product analytics, and reporting. 
	    Recently, I am interested in building my own website using HTML and CSS. Hope here can be a good place to 
		share my thoughts, interests, and data knowlege.

		Algorithms
	</h2>
	<p> Algorithms is a popular word in Machine Learning and Data Science. But can you use some simple 
		sentences to explain what it is? This year, I have been learning algorithms from Professor Pavel Panchekha.
		I want to share and discuss some algorithms topics with you! For example, how many steps do you need to put 
		an elephant into the fridge?... Ok, It's a joke, but I do want to try my new Apple Pencil to draw a picture... (please forgive my painting skills...)</p>

		The limitation of Data
	</h2>
	<p>Mathematics can be challenging for many, but it's an essential discipline to learn, especially in today's world where statistics are frequently used in 
	   fields such as politics, economics, and health. However, understanding the real significance behind these numbers can be daunting. For example, the recent
	   news on the potential link between artificial sweeteners and heart disease has gained widespread attention. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the 
	   study's findings may be limited as the majority of participants had cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular issues, potentially 
	   skewing the data. Having worked in data reporting for five years, I strongly believe that understanding the limitations of data is crucial before using it 
	   to propose something.

	<p>Dolce far niente, sweetness of doing nothing. Life has ups and downs. If I share something here, it must means that it's my joy :) </p>
