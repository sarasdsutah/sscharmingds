    <h2> Why I love Data</h2>
    <p> 
        As you see, I choose my website domain as sscharmingds. I want to show people that data also can be charming, fun and useful.
        Data is not only about number, but also can be some enjoyable and unforgettable moments in your time. For example, the pictures in your photo album are some data points about you; the member in your family tree are some data points about your family history; 
        The reason that I love data is that it can help me record different moments in my life. And also, if we use those data in the right way, they may also can help us better our lives.
