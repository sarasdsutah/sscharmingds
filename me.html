    <p> 
        I am a tech woman with 3 years' experience as data professional. I have experience with executive decision support, technical leadership, consistently delivering high-quality results,
        mentoring junior team members, and coordinating with other business functions. Beside work, I enjoy traveling, food, Jazz and learning new skills. I have been to several countries, including Japan, France, Itaily and Spain.
        Originally, I'm from the most beautiful city, Shanghai.

    <h1> Why I love Data</h1>
    <p> 
        As you can see, I chose sscharmingds as my website domain. I want to show people that data also can be charming, fun and useful.
        Data is not only about numbers, but also the enjoyable and unforgettable moments in your life. For example, the pictures in your photo album are data points about you; the members of your family tree are data points about your family history.
        The reason that I love data is that it helps me record the moments of my life. And also, if we use these data in the right way, they can also help us better our lives. 
    </p>
    <h1> The data event that I have been working on... </h1>
    <p>
        That is Women in Data Science event in 2021! As a minority woman in Utah, I always want to find my way to help the community. I am an Ambassador for Utah's Women in Data Science event, WiDS Salt Lake City, since 2019. WiDS SLC is an independent event organized 
        to coincide with the annual Global Women in Data Science (WiDS) Conference held at Stanford University and an estimated 150+ locations worldwide. All genders are invited to attend WiDS regional events, 
        which features outstanding women doing outstanding work. The Global Women in Data Science (WiDS) Conference aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. 
        This one-day technical conference provides an opportunity to hear about the latest data science related research and applications in a broad set of domains.
        I'll be sharing more details soon...
